### Discord
You need the **[Game SDK](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/sdk-starter-guide)**. <br>
Copy the `discord_game_sdk.h`, `discord_game_sdk.dll.lib` as well as `discord_game_sdk.dll` into the `discord` directory.
You can take either the `x86` or `x86_64` version, both will work.

### iTunes
For Ongaku Windows, you need the COM Interface for iTunes. <br>
You can download that on Apple's **[Developer Downloads](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/)** website. <br>
Copy `iTunesCOMInterface_i.c` and `iTunesCOMInterface.h` into the `itunes` directory.
