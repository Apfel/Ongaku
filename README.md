# Ongaku for Windows
A port of **[Ongaku](https://github.com/spotlightishere/Ongaku)** for Windows.  
Ongaku is an application that allows you to share your iTunes presence in Discord.  
Requires **[Discord](https://discordapp.com)** and **[iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/)**.  

## Usage
Just run `Ongaku.exe`!  
To quit, click the Ongaku icon in the System Tray.

## Building
First and foremost, Ongaku for Windows only works on, you guessed it, Windows.  
macOS users need to use Ongaku (see above) itself.  
Since there's no iTunes client for Linux, Linux is unsupported, too.

The C++ workload is required.

For additional building instructions in regards to the used modules, refer to the `README.md` file in the `modules` folder.
