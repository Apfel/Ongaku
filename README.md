# Ongaku for Windows
A port of **[Ongaku](https://github.com/spotlightishere/Ongaku)** for Windows. <br>
Ongaku is an application that allows you to share your iTunes presence in Discord. <br>
Requires **[Discord](https://discordapp.com)** and **[iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/)**. <br>

## Usage
Just run `Ongaku.exe`!
To quit, click the Ongaku icon in the System Tray.

## Building
First and foremost, Ongaku for Windows only works on, you guessed it, Windows. <br>
macOS users need to use Ongaku (see above) itself. <br>
Since there's no iTunes client for Linux, Linux is unsupported, too.

You need the C++ workload with at least the MSVC, the Windows SDK and the CMake components installed.

For additional building instructions in regards to the used modules, refer to the `README.md` file in the `modules` folder.
